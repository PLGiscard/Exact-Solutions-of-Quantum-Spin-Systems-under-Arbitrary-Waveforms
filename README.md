# Exact Solutions of Quantum Spin Systems under Arbitrary Waveforms Using Algebraic Graph Theory

M. Foroozandeh, P.-L. Giscard, 04/2022

Set of Matlab codes for solving one spin systems in SU(2) and SO(3) representations using ode45, PCPA (piecewise-constant propagator approximation) expansion and path-sum with trapezoidal and average Simpson quadrature rules. 

For one spin system in SU(2) representation, run: test_compare  (note all parameters can be set in the file)

For one spin system in SO(3) representation, run: test_compare_bloch  (note all parameters can be set in the file)

For two spin system in SU(4) representation, run: test_compare_2  (note all parameters can be set in the file)
